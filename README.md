# GitLanding

GitLanding automatically generates a clean and user friendly landing page for open source projects that can be shared with non technical users that may find github confusing to navigate.

To get get a link for a project simply replace `github` with `gitlanding`.
For example, https://**github**.com/microsoft/vscode becomes https://**gitlanding**.com/microsoft/vscode
